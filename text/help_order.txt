Order creates new orders from Blender files in a project repository.

$1Order Usage$0
------------

    souschef $1order$0 path/to/file.blend [output] [--flags]

Because 'order' is the default command, the keyword can actually be omitted:

    souschef path/to/file.blend [path/to/output] [--flags]

$1Outputs$0
-------

When overriding a file path, Sous Chef will take into account any additional file nodes in the scene's compositor tree, redirecting all paths to the new output.

A scene with file nodes should be set up for normal use: the file should work when regular GUI rendering is being used.

Sous Chef assumes all of the paths in the project are well-formulated and relative; you usually want all your render data coming out in the same place, but absolute paths work too.

Even so, there's a high chance of bugs with complex combinations of file outputs.  Certain odd combinations of absolute and relative paths or mixed absolute mounting points have not been thoroughly tested, so please be careful with complex outputs.

$1Cache$0
-----

    $1--cache -c$0

Specifies that this order should be cached, which means packed up into a discreet copy and filed away to protect it from ongoing changes.  This feature requires the Blender Asset Tracer.

$1Target$0
------

    $1--target -t$0

Select a Blender target for your order.  Use $1souschef targets$0 to see the available list in the current project.

$1Replace$0
-------

    $1--replace name$0

Create a new order with new parameters, but do so while also replacing an existing order.  This will $1not$0 preserve its timestamp and will bump it to the back of the queue.  The entire order is rebuilt.

$1Resolution$0
----------

    $1--resolution -r 1000x1000$0

Overrides the output resolution.  Both X and Y dimensions must be supplied.

There is also an (incomplete) shortcut table of common resolutions:

    $1UHD$0     3840 x 2160
    $1HD$0      1920 x 1080

    $1DCP4K$0   4096 x 1716
    $1DCP2K$0   2048 x 858

$1Frame$0
-----

    $1-f 48$0
    $1--frame 1:250$0

Overrides the frame-range of the output.  If only one value is supplied, it will used as the end frame, with the starting frame assumed to be 1.
