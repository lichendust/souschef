Order creates new orders from Blender files in a project repository.

$1Order Usage$0
------------

    souschef $1order$0 path/to/file.blend [output] [--flags]

Because 'order' is the default command, the keyword can actually be omitted:

    souschef path/to/file.blend [path/to/output] [--flags]

$1Outputs$0
-------

The file paths for any order outputs are capable of taking into account file nodes in addition to standard compositor output.  Files should be set up for normal use, as if Sous Chef didn't exist.  If the path is then overridden in a Sous Chef order, the program tries its very best to untangle all of the paths and move everything seamlessly to a new output location, preserving the various outputs' own relativity in that new directory.

$1Cache$0
-----

    $1--cache -c$0

Specifies that this order should be cached, which means packed up into a discreet copy and filed away to protect it from ongoing changes.  This feature requires the Blender Asset Tracer.

$1Target$0
------

    $1--target -t$0

Select a Blender target for your order.  Use $1souschef targets$0 to see the available list in the current project.

$1Replace$0
-------

    $1--replace name$0

Create a new order with new parameters, but specifically overwrite an existing order.  This will $1not$0 keep its timestamp and will bump it to the back of the queue.  The entire order is rebuilt.

$1Resolution$0
----------

    $1--resolution -r 1000x1000$0

Overrides the output resolution.  Both X and Y dimensions must be supplied.

There is also an (incomplete) shortcut table of common resolutions:

    $1UHD$0     3840 x 2160
    $1HD$0      1920 x 1080

    $1DCP4K$0   4096 x 1716
    $1DCP2K$0   2048 x 858

$1Frame$0
-----

    $1-f 48$0
    $1--frame 1:250$0

Overrides the frame-range of the output.  If only one value is supplied, it will used as the end frame, with the starting frame assumed to be 1.
