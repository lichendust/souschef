# üç± Sous Chef

Sous Chef is a rendering assistant for large Blender projects with small teams.

It helps with partitioning scenes and dependencies for rendering, as well as queueing and managing batches of renders, all with the goal of avoiding "my workstation is tied up right now" problems that sap valuable working time.

## Manifesto

Unlike most farm tools that focus on distributing and managing render workloads across many computers, like [Flamenco](https://flamenco.io), Sous Chef is the opposite.

Rather than many machines running one job, Sous Chef looks after one machine running many jobs.

To briefly explain, Sous Chef creates a directory ‚Äî `.souschef` ‚Äî in the root of a production's repository, most likely alongside a similar version control directory like `.git` or `.hg`.  This directory stores a running list of jobs that are queued in the order they arrive in (presently).  Each job *may* hold an entire clone of the target scene and its dependencies, allowing work to progress without fear of changing resources during rendering.

On a personal device, this allows jobs to be "banked" during a day's work, then running the queue overnight.  On a dedicated computer connected to a NAS, Sous Chef can watch the job directory, allowing multiple artists to submit jobs using the command, rendered on a first-come first-served basis, like a build server.

## Sous Chef?

*Sous Chef* is an oblique reference to an analogy I use to explain 'rendering' 3D scenes to people who actually go outside: If modelling and animating are the cooking, then rendering is putting it all in the oven at the end.

## Usage

Sous Chef is a single, portable binary.

### Jobs

Sous Chef, in its current form, can act in one of two ways in regards to job creation:

- It can create a job in-place, using the working copy of the film on disk, with obvious concurrency risks (editing assets could cause issues with the ongoing job).
- It can cache a job's files using [BAT](https://developer.blender.org/source/blender-asset-tracer/browse/master), eliminating concurrency risks at the cost of disk space (a single job could feasibly require a full clone of the entire project, doubling the required disk space for the lifespan of the job).

### Render Queue

Creating a job is not *starting* a job.  Sous Chef can, once jobs have been created, start them in two ways:

- Start and render the job queue, exiting when finished.
- Start and render the job queue, remaining alive and watching the job directory for new ones.

## Blender Asset Tracer

In order to use the cache feature, Sous Chef requires a copy of the [Blender Asset Tracer](https://developer.blender.org/source/blender-asset-tracer/browse/master/).  BAT provides a small suite of tools for inspecting Blender files and their dependencies, automating the rewriting of those connections and packing up scenes and their dependencies to make them wholly portable (and as small as reasonably possible) for render farms.

Sous Chef should not rely on BAT long term.

<!-- ### Installing BAT

BAT requires Python 3.10+ (though it seems Python 3+ is generally fine).

1. Run `pip3 install blender-asset-manager`
2. Ensure your PATH is correctly set up to allow the `bat` command to run natively -->
