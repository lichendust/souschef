# üç± Sous Chef

Sous Chef is a rendering assistant for large Blender projects.

It helps with partitioning scenes and dependencies for rendering, as well as queueing and managing batches of renders, all with the goal of avoiding "my workstation is tied up right now" problems that sap valuable working time.

## Manifesto

Unlike most farm tools that focus on distributing and managing render workloads across many computers, like [Flamenco](https://flamenco.io), Sous Chef is the opposite.

Rather than many machines running one job, Sous Chef looks after one machine running many jobs.

To briefly explain, Sous Chef creates a directory ‚Äî `.souschef` ‚Äî in the root of a production's repository, most likely alongside a similar version control directory like `.git` or `.hg`.  This directory stores a running list of jobs that are queued in the order they arrive in (presently).  Each job may optionally hold an entire clone of the target scene and its dependencies, allowing work to progress without fear of changing resources during rendering.

On a personal device, this mode allows scenes and their dependencies to be protected and locked while ongoing changes are made to the rest of the project.

<!-- On a dedicated computer connected to a NAS hosting the project, Sous Chef can also watch the job directory, allowing multiple artists to submit jobs using the command, rendered on a first-come first-served basis, similar to a build server. -->

### Sous Chef?

*'Sous Chef'* is an oblique reference to an analogy I use to explain the rendering step to people who actually go outside: If modelling and animating are the cooking, then rendering is putting it all in the oven at the end.  If you're the head chef, Sous Chef is the... well, sous.

## Usage

Sous Chef is a single, portable binary that *tries* to contain everything.  It does optionally depend on Python for the caching feature ‚Äî [see below](#blender-asset-tracer).

## Basic Commands

The base Sous Chef commands, which should always be the first argument, are ‚Äî

- `init`
- `order`
- `list`
- `render`
- `clean`

There's also the usual self-explanatory stuff ‚Äî

- `help`
- `version`

It should be noted that Sous Chef's help command is extremely powerful and provides detailed information about every command, flag and setting available within Sous Chef.

### Init

	souschef init

Initialise a new Sous Chef directory.  This should be done at the top-level of a production's repository.

### Order

A render job in Sous Chef is called an "order".  You can create a new order with ‚Äî

	souschef order path/to/file.blend

`order` is actually the default expression of Sous Chef, which means you can omit the keyword ‚Äî

	souschef path/to/file.blend

You can also specify the output location with a second unflagged argument ‚Äî

	souschef path/to/file.blend some/render/frame_######

The file paths for output are actually capable of taking into account file nodes in addition to standard compositor output.  Files can be set up for normal use, as if Sous Chef didn't exist.  If the path is then overriden in a Sous Chef order, the program tries its very best to untangle all of the paths and move everything seamlessly to a new output location, preserving the various outputs' own relativity in that new directory.  This *may be buggy right now*.  You have been warned.

Sous Chef can act in one of two ways in regards to order creation:

- **Live copy**: It can create an order in-place, using the working copy of the film on disk, with obvious concurrency risks (editing assets could cause issues with the ongoing order).
- **Cache**: It can cache an orders's files using [Blender Asset Tracer](#blender-asset-tracer), eliminating concurrency risks at the cost of disk space (a single order could feasibly require a full clone of the entire project, doubling the required disk space for the lifespan of the order).

### List

	souschef list

Show a list of the current jobs, active, complete or otherwise.

### Render

	souschef render

Start rendering the currently registered list of jobs.

Creating a order is not *starting* a order.  Sous Chef can, once jobs have been created, start them in two ways:

- Start and render the order queue, exiting when finished.
- (‚ö† Not implemented yet) Start and render the order queue, remaining alive and watching the order directory for new ones to be added by other instances of Sous Chef.

### Clean

You can purge the order directory with ‚Äî

	souschef clean

This only removes finished jobs by default, but you can purge all jobs with the additional `--hard` flag.

## Order Parameters

When creating an order, there are a number of additional options available.

Any values that affect settings which are also defined in a scene file are optional: the file's original settings will be used in their absence.

### Cache

	--cache
	-c

Specifies that this order should be cached, which means packed up into a discreet copy and filed away to protect it from ongoing changes.  This feature requires [BAT](#blender-asset-tracer).

### Target

	--target [name]
	-t [name]

Allows you to choose a Blender target for your order, in case of split versions or compatibility issues on a project[^1].  See the [configuration below](#default-configuration) for the exact meaning of a target.

### Replace

	--replace [name]

Create a new order with new parameters, but specifically overwrite an existing order.  This will *not* keep its timestamp and will bump it to the back of the queue.

Useful for any missed configuration, but it will rebuild the entire order.

### Resolution

	--resolution 1000x1000
	-r 1000x1000

Override the output resolution.  Both X and Y dimensions must be supplied.

Sous Chef also has a very primitive shortcut table, which is currently hard-coded to my daily uses (because they're all 2.35:1).  I'm documenting them here for posterity, but these *will change*.  I may even decouple resolution from aspect ratio to make things more flexible.

	-r dcp4k

- `UHD` ‚Äî 3840x1608
- `HD` ‚Äî 1920x804
- `DCP4K` ‚Äî 4096x1716
- `DCP2K` ‚Äî 2048x858

### Frame

	--frame 1:250
	-f 300

Override the frame-range.  If only one value is supplied, it's used as the end frame, with the starting frame assumed to be 1.

## Default Configuration

When calling `souschef init`, the default project configuration will look something similar to this, adjusted for your operating system ‚Äî

```toml
default_target = "2.93"

[[blender_target]]
name = "2.93"
path = "C:/Program Files/Blender Foundation/Blender 2.93/blender.exe"

[[blender_target]]
name = "3.5"
path = "C:/Program Files/Blender Foundation/Blender 3.5/blender.exe"

[[blender_target]]
name = "canary"
path = "X:/dev/buildbot/custom-blender.exe"
```

This configuration is primarily aimed at sorting out Blender versions, especially if you're extremely sensible and lock versions on projects or even distribute internal portable builds to ensure things don't break across artists' computers.

You can use any name you like for each target and create as many targets as you wish.  When you use the `--target` flag, the name is the argument you pass.

In future, this file will allow for more configuration, such as templating project-wide paths like render output directories.

## Version Control

If you use project-wide version control, it is recommended to add exclusion rules for `.souschef/orders`, but *check in* the project configuration file `.souschef/config.toml`.

## Blender Asset Tracer

In order to use the cache feature, Sous Chef requires a copy of the [Blender Asset Tracer](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender-asset-tracer).  BAT provides a small suite of tools for inspecting Blender files and their dependencies, automating the rewriting of those connections and packing up scenes and their dependencies to make them wholly portable (and as small as reasonably possible) for render farms.

Sous Chef should not rely on BAT long term.  In an ideal world, BAT would function as an addon or component of Blender with the same stringent upgrade requirements.  As it stands, BAT can sometimes lag behind Blender versions for months or years until a particularly pragmatic Blender developer comes along to maintain it.

The complexity, planned inconsistency and lack of documentation for the Blender file format ‚Äî a `.blend` is merely a direct serialisation of Blender's entire runtime scene data structure ‚Äî makes writing an external program that parses it difficult.

This is why Sous Chef actually calls to Blender itself to get information about new orders, by loading the file, having it print relevant information and then closing.  Even Blender's own DNA inspectors [use Blender itself](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/src/branch/main/doc/blender_file_format) to write the dump.

Directly porting BAT could be an option, but at 8.5K lines of Python, it's very much a non-trivial exercise that would require the attention of a developer who wholly understands BAT itself and the intricacies of Blender's innards.

### Installing BAT

To be clear, only the cache feature of Sous Chef requires BAT.  For the intended audience of Sous Chef ‚Äî single artists ‚Äî it's more than likely that BAT is not necessary.

BAT requires Python 3.10+ (though it seems Python 3+ is generally fine).

1. Run `pip3 install blender-asset-manager`.
2. Ensure your PATH is correctly set up to allow the new `bat` command to run natively.  `pip` should warn if this is not already the case.
3. Sous Chef should now be able to find the BAT command after a restart of your shell.

### Windows Users and the Subsystem

If you are using Windows with the Subsystem for Linux, you'll still need to use the Windows build of Sous Chef and install Windows Python.  Mixing a Windows copy of Blender with WSL Python and Sous Chef *could work*, but the spaghetti of path mixing is untenable for me as a maintainer and infuriating to set up correctly for a user.

You can still use `souschef.exe` through WSL, as I do, which works perfectly for relative paths.

[^1]: The very first version of Sous Chef was born out of the fact that I had a project stuck on proxy rigs in 2.93 but wanted to take advantage of Cycles X during the 3.0 transition.  I could work in 2.93 and render in 3.0 without worrying about accidentally breaking files or opening them in the wrong version and clattering the rigs.  This was during that 3.0-3.2 phase where proxy conversions just made everything worse.  It's less relevant now, but still a useful feature.
