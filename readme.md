# üç± Sous Chef

Sous Chef is a rendering assistant for large Blender projects with small teams.

It helps with partitioning scenes and dependencies for rendering, as well as queueing and managing batches of renders, all with the goal of avoiding "my workstation is tied up right now" problems that sap valuable working time.

## Manifesto

Unlike most farm tools that focus on distributing and managing render workloads across many computers, like [Flamenco](https://flamenco.io), Sous Chef is the opposite.

Rather than many machines running one job, Sous Chef looks after one machine running many jobs.

To briefly explain, Sous Chef creates a directory ‚Äî `.souschef` ‚Äî in the root of a production's repository, most likely alongside a similar version control directory like `.git` or `.hg`.  This directory stores a running list of jobs that are queued in the order they arrive in (presently).  Each job may optionally hold an entire clone of the target scene and its dependencies, allowing work to progress without fear of changing resources during rendering.

On a personal device, this mode allows scenes and their dependencies to be protected and locked while ongoing changes are made to the rest of the project.

On a dedicated computer connected to a NAS hosting the project, Sous Chef can also watch the job directory, allowing multiple artists to submit jobs using the command, rendered on a first-come first-served basis, similar to a build server.

## Sous Chef?

*Sous Chef* is an oblique reference to an analogy I use to explain 'rendering' 3D scenes to people who actually go outside: If modelling and animating are the cooking, then rendering is putting it all in the oven at the end.

## Usage

Sous Chef is a single, portable binary that *tries* to contain everything.  It does optionally depend on Python for the caching feature ‚Äî [see below](#blender-asset-tracer).

### Orders

In Sous Chef, a render job is called an "order".

Sous Chef, in its current form, can act in one of two ways in regards to order creation:

- **Live copy**: It can create an order in-place, using the working copy of the film on disk, with obvious concurrency risks (editing assets could cause issues with the ongoing order).
- **Cache**: It can cache an orders's files using [Blender Asset Tracer](#blender-asset-tracer), eliminating concurrency risks at the cost of disk space (a single order could feasibly require a full clone of the entire project, doubling the required disk space for the lifespan of the order).

### Render Queue

Creating a order is not *starting* a order.  Sous Chef can, once jobs have been created, start them in two ways:

- Start and render the order queue, exiting when finished.
- (‚ö† Not implemented yet) Start and render the order queue, remaining alive and watching the order directory for new ones to be added by other instances of Sous Chef.  This is the "build server" mode as described above.

### Commands

	souschef init

	souschef job

	souschef list

	souschef render

	souschef clean

## Version Control

If you use project-wide version control, it is recommended to add exclusion rules for `.souschef/orders`, but check in the project configuration file `.souschef/config.toml`.

## Blender Asset Tracer

In order to use the cache feature, Sous Chef requires a copy of the [Blender Asset Tracer](https://developer.blender.org/source/blender-asset-tracer/browse/master/).  BAT provides a small suite of tools for inspecting Blender files and their dependencies, automating the rewriting of those connections and packing up scenes and their dependencies to make them wholly portable (and as small as reasonably possible) for render farms.

Sous Chef should not rely on BAT long term.  In an ideal world, BAT would function as an addon or component of Blender with the same stringent upgrade requirements.  As it stands, BAT can sometimes lag behind Blender versions for months or years until a particularly pragmatic Blender developer comes along to maintain it.

The complexity, planned inconsistency and lack of documentation for the Blender file format ‚Äî a `.blend` is merely a direct serialisation of Blender's entire runtime scene data structure ‚Äî makes writing an external program that parses it difficult.

This is why Sous Chef actually calls to Blender itself to get information about new orders, by loading the file, having it print relevant information and then closing.  Even Blender's own historical DNA inspectors [use Blender itself](https://developer.blender.org/diffusion/B/browse/master/doc/blender_file_format/) to write the dump.

Directly porting BAT could be an option, but at 8.5K lines of Python, it's very much a non-trivial exercise that would require the attention of a developer who wholly understands BAT itself and the intricacies of Blender's innards.

### Installing BAT

To be clear, only the cache feature of Sous Chef requires BAT.  For the intended audience of Sous Chef ‚Äî single artists ‚Äî it's more than likely that BAT is not necessary.

BAT requires Python 3.10+ (though it seems Python 3+ is generally fine).

1. Run `pip3 install blender-asset-manager`.
2. Ensure your PATH is correctly set up to allow the new `bat` command to run natively.  `pip` should warn if this is not already the case.
3. Sous Chef should now be able to find the BAT command after a restart of your shell.

### Windows Users and the Subsystem

If you are using Windows with the Subsystem for Linux, you'll still need to use the Windows build of Sous Chef and install Windows Python.  Mixing a Windows copy of Blender with WSL Python and Sous Chef *could work*, but the spaghetti of path mixing is untenable for me as a maintainer and infuriating to set up correctly for a user.

You can still use `souschef.exe` through WSL, as I do, which works perfectly for relative paths.
